# Global airline routes data with airfare price prediction model

This was created to support my Data structures Algorithms group assignment which is to create a program that would
recommend the best flight options based on user input. We needed datapoints for the program therefore this was created.

The goal of this project was to get my feet wet in data analytics and data modeling. \
The model created from this project is definitely not representative of current airline pricing trends. However, the data we
need for the project doesn't have to be accurate, so I guess this is good enough.

## What I wanted to do but didn't
If this was a proper data analytics project, I will attempt to do the following

- Estimate fuel used - by making an educated guess on the plane used for the route
- Estimate fuel pricing - Based on crude oil futures pricing, current crude oil pricing and estimated refinery cost at that time
- Estimate cost per passenger - Based on airplane passenger capacity and fuel cost for the route
- Scrapping more data from different geographical regions would create a model with greater accuracy
